The aim of this project was to further Kubernetes skills as follows:
1. Provision servers with Ansible
2. Use a local docker repository setup on master node
3. Understand what Helm can do 
4. Scale using a metric collected by Prometheus

The basic setup was 4 uBuntu servers on AWS.
A simple setup on a VPC with a public only network.
    1 Kubernetes master server
    1 Nginx ingress server
    2 web servers
Security group needed port 6443 open for TCP so nodes could talk to the master.
This was a useful doc especially with network setup:

We use a simple hello world web app to be found on the docker hub at:
    yerachw/flaskube:latest
It's gunicorn server listens on port 8080.

We installed Nginx Ingress using this version:
    https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/
mandatory was modified to include an ssl certificate and a default backend
Certificate created as per above doc
